!Series_summary = METTL16, a well-characterized m6A methyltransferase, has recently been reported to contribute to tumorigenesis in various types of cancer. However, the role of METTL16 in tumor progression under restricted nutrient conditions, which commonly occur in tumor microenvironment, has yet to be elucidated. Herein, our study initially reported the inhibitory effect of METTL16 depletion on apoptosis, leading to increased lung cancer cell survival under amino acid starvation conditions. Mechanistically, we determined that METTL16 knockdown represses the expression of ATF4, a multifunctional transcription regulatory protein, in the GCN2-eIF2α-dependent manner. Reduction of ATF4 further reduces the expression of apoptotic receptor protein DR5, thereby impairing apoptosis and promoting cancer cell survival. Additionally, treatment of TIC10, an inducer of the DR5 pathway, sufficiently restored the METTL16 deficiency-induced apoptosis in amino acid-starved cells. Taken together, our study provides compelling evidence for the involvement of METTL16 in regulating cancer progression, suggesting a rethink about METTL16 as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
!Series_overall_design = To investigate the potential role of METTL16 under nutrient deprivation, stable METTL16-knockdown (M16-KD) cell lines were initially constructed using two classic A549 NSCLC cells,  through a shRNA-based gene interference approach.
